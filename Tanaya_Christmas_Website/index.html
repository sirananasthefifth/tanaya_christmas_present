        <p class="text">You may be wondering: "What is this?" and "How did I end up here?". Well, ever since I learned how to make a website I've always wanted to make one for you. But what kind of website would I make? And what was to be my Christmas present from you?
            <br><br>
            This website contains a collection of mini-gifts for you! To find them you just click on the three lines in the top left corner of the screen. There you will find links to the different webpages of this website (two words which I taught you the difference of ;)).
            <br><br>
            I hope you enjoy this present baby!!!!! I'm smiling as I'm writing this because I just can't wait to see your reaction to this!!!!
            <br><br>
            I love you Tanaya and Merry Christmas!
